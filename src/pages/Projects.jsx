This website utilizes advanced machine learning techniques to analyze and categorize images based on their content, allowing users to easily classify and organize their image collections. this project , I have classified image using SVM. For data collection we have used a chrome extension called fatkun. We have done data cleaning using Haar cascade.For feature engineering we have used wavelet transform that helps moving window to detect eyes and face .At last, we have built UI."
